v0.04
* Experimental support for MaxQuant MBR
* Added Dinosaur converter
* Fixed some converter scripts Python 3 compatibility (#12)
* Fixed problem with standalone percolator input for dinosaur converter
* Add support for disabling multithreading (by setting --num_threads 1)

v0.03.1
* Added issued command to log
* Fixed MaxQuant converter with fractionated data (#10)
* Fixed small issues with posterior distribution package

v0.03
* Added support for converting Quandenser and MaxQuant results to Triqler input format (#5)
* Added support for printing posterior distributions to a file
* Added support for plotting posterior distributions and hyperparameter estimation fits

v0.02.1
* Fixed problems with CSV reading and writing on Windows (#9)
* Fixed lambda function pickling problem with multiprocessing on Windows (#8)

v0.02
* Fixed empty columns as extra proteins issue (#4)
* Improved logging messages
* Optimizations for very large datasets. Replaced some operations on python lists by their numpy equivalents to speed up calculation on larger datasets. Also, we now skip the posterior calculation for proteins with identification PEP = 1.0, since they will never be differentially abundant anyway.

v0.01.4
* Fixed windows multiprocessing error more elegantly (#2)
* Suppressed warnings from child processes (#3)

v0.01.3
* Fixed Windows multiprocessing error (#2)
* Added spectrum identifier to peptide output

v0.01.2
* Bumped numpy dependency to 1.12 for numpy.count_nonzero along axis
* Removed need for cond_idx:cond_name format for condition column
* Set --min_samples option to 2 instead of 1 and added check for --min_samples >= 2
* Added filter for entries with 0 or NaN intensity
* Added run dependent identification PEP for consensus spectra

v0.01.1
* Fixed dependency on qvality (#1)
* Changed to (slightly slower) 2D integration for in-group variance latent variable.

v0.01.0
* Initial release
